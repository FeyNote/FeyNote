title: Desktop Panes
---

The desktop UI is a paneable, flexible interface that allows you to arrange your workspace in a way that suits you best.
You can have multiple panes open at the same time, and you can resize and rearrange them as you see fit.
When visiting the desktop UI for the first time, you will see a single pane with the default layout.

## Tabs

You can create a new tab by clicking the "+" button in the navigation.
Tabs can contain any of the apps pages, and by default opening any page will open in your last active tab, unless you choose an option such as "open in new tab" or "open in vertical split".

## Panes

Tabs can be dragged to create new panes.
Grab the tab by the title (the portion that sits in the navigation bar) and drag it to the side of the window to create a new pane.
You can also drag tabs to the top or bottom of the window to create a new pane that spans the entire width of the window.

Your pane layout will be preserved across sessions, so you can come back to your workspace exactly as you left it.

## Left Side Menu

The left side menu serves as a navigation menu.
You'll see shortcuts for [search](artifacts/search), the [dashboard](layout/dashboard), your [artifact graph](artifacts/graph), your [artifact tree](artifacts/tree), your [ai threads](ai), and your [settings](settings/general).
The left side menu can be collapsed by clicking the icon in the top corner of the menu.

## Right Side Menu

The right side menu serves as a contextually-aware options menu.
You'll see options for the current page, such as [sharing](artifacts/sharing) or [references](artifacts/references) for artifacts.
The right side menu can be collapsed by clicking the icon in the top corner of the menu.

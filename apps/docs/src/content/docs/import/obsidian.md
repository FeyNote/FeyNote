Importing your files from Obsidian can be done in a few simple steps;

1. First open up Obsidian and find the ellipsis located in the top right corner of your application.

### Step 3: Locate and Zip Your Vault

Clicking on that dropdown option will open up your system's file explorer and plant you somewhere within your **"Obsidian Vault"** folder.  
Navigate outwards to where you can select this folder, right-click, and select the option to compress it to a zip.

### Step 1: Open the Ellipsis Menu
First open up Logseq and find the ellipsis located in the top right corner of your application.

### Step 2: Export Your Graph
Select the option from the dropdown menu called **"Export Graph"**.

### Step 3: Export as JSON
Select the "Export as Json" option from the popover that appears.

### Step 4: Open in Directory
Unfortunately, the JSON export doesn't contain any images you might have attached to your notes, so next we need to head back to the ellipsis dropdown from step one and select **"Open in directory"**.

### Step 5: Locate the Logseq Folder
Clicking that button will open up your system's file explorer and plant you somewhere within your **"Logseq"** folder.  
To find your images, navigate to the base level of your Logseq folder.

### Step 6: Copy the Assets Folder
At the base level of your Logseq folder you'll see an **"assets"** folder.  
Copy that folder out to wherever you've saved the exported JSON of your graph.

---

### Step 7: Zip the Files Together
Finally, now that we have both the assets folder and the exported graph, we want to zip the two of them together.  
Select both your assets folder and your graph, right-click and select the option to compress to zip.

That's it! Your graph is now zipped up and ready to upload!

## Overview

The editor is the main interface for creating and editing documents.
It is a rich text editor that supports many of the features you might be familiar with other note taking editors, but has some unique and powerful features oriented towards tabletop games.

## Slash Commands

At any time, you can type `/` to bring up a list of slash commands.
After using the `/` key, you can filter the list of commands by typing the name of the command you want to use. Hit `enter` or click a command to execute.

- `/header` - [Switch current block to heading mode](#headers-and-paragraphs)
- `/paragraph` - [Switch current block to paragraph mode](#headers-and-paragraphs)
- `/horizontal rule` - [Insert horizontal rule](#horizontal-rule)
- `/list` - [Insert list](#lists)

## Headers and Paragraphs

Headers and paragraphs are the most basic elements of a document.
Several levels of heading are supported, and can be created via a [slash command](#slash-commands).
You can also create headers quickly by typing `#` on a blank new line followed by a space.
Multiple `#` symbols (such as `###`) will create an increasing level of heading.

## Horizontal Rule

Horizontal rules are used to separate sections of a document.
They can be created via a [slash command](#slash-commands).
You can also create a horizontal rule quickly by typing `---` on a blank new line followed by a space.

## Lists

Lists are used to create ordered and unordered lists.
They can be created via a [slash command](#slash-commands).
You can also create a list quickly by typing `-` or `1.` on a blank new line followed by a space.
While editing an item in a list, you can use the `tab` key to create a nested list or `shift + tab` to outdent a nested item.

## Monster and Item Blocks

Monster and item blocks are used to create blocks that represent monsters and items in a tabletop game.
They can be created via a [slash command](#slash-commands).
They'll come with default content to help you format your monster.

We also recommend that you use the [ai](/docs/ai) to help you create monsters and items from web links.

## Tables

Tables are used to create tables of data.
They can be created via a [slash command](#slash-commands).
A table will come with a default row and column.
You can add or delete more rows and columns by using [slash commands](#slash-commands).

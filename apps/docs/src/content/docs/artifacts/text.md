## Overview

The editor is the main interface for creating and editing documents.
It is a rich text editor that supports many of the features you might be familiar with other note taking editors, but has some unique and powerful features oriented towards tabletop games.

## Headers and Paragraphs

Headers and paragraphs are the most basic elements of a document.
Several levels of heading are supported, and can be created via the toolbar menus.
You can also create headers quickly by typing `#` on a blank new line followed by a space.
Multiple `#` symbols (such as `###`) will create an increasing level of heading.

## Horizontal Rule

Horizontal rules are used to separate sections of a document.
They can be created via the Insert menu in the toolbar.
You can also create a horizontal rule quickly by typing `---` on a blank new line followed by a space.

## Lists

Lists are used to create ordered and unordered lists.
They can be created via the toolbar menus.
You can also create a list quickly by typing `-` or `1.` on a blank new line followed by a space.
While editing an item in a list, you can use the `tab` key to create a nested list or `shift + tab` to outdent a nested item.

## Monster and Item Blocks

Monster and item blocks are used to create blocks that represent monsters and items in a tabletop game.
They can be created via the Insert menu in the toolbar.
They'll come with default content to help you format your monster.

We also recommend that you use the [ai](/docs/ai) to help you create monsters and items from web links.

## Tables

Tables are used to create tables of data.
They can be created via the Insert menu in the toolbar.
A table will come with a default row and column.
You can add or delete more rows and columns via the table bubble menu that appears when your cursor is inside a table.

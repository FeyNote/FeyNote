### Step 3: Locate the Downloaded Files

Open up your system's **File Explorer** and navigate to the folder you've downloaded your Google Drive files too. If you've downloaded multiple files at once your files should come prebundled as a zip and you can proceed to step 5. If you've downloaded a single file, please compress it as described in step 4.

### Step 4: Select and Compress Your Files

Select the Docx file you've downloaded, right-click and find the compress to zip option within your native file system.

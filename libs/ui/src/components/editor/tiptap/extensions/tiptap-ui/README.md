# Tiptap UI

I grabbed everything in this directory from Tiptap's new UI stuff here: https://tiptap.dev/docs/ui-components/components/overview

So it's all generated with `npx @tiptap/cli@latest add link-popover` and then customized. Their licenses are open source, but I do recommend using their CLI generator in a different directory since it messes with things, then copying the code into here.
